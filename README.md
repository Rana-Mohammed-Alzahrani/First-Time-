# First-Time- Project

This is one of my previous projects. It includes:

- Uploading a Jupyter Notebook file containing AI analysis or a machine learning model.
- Uploading a dataset file in CSV format downloaded from Kaggle.
- Tools used: Jupyter Notebook, GitHub, and Kaggle.
- Through this project, I learned the basics of GitHub and how to share my work professionally.

📁 Files:
- `Project_ML.ipynb`: The notebook file containing the code.
- `Dataset.csv`: The dataset used in the project.
